# Mapbase Game Sources

This repository contains all files which compose Mapbase's mod folders and VPKs, except for compiled files like DLLs. FGDs are also hosted on another repository.

This repository accepts pull requests for contributing scripts, assets, or other file changes to Mapbase.

---

This repo includes an amateur shell script (`mapbase-build-packaging-script.sh`) which is used to assemble builds of Mapbase's mod folders. This script was originally created for personal use, but efforts have been made to try to allow it to be used by anyone. A more efficient and/or user-friendly solution may be introduced in the future.
